# Neural-Networks

This is my Neural Networks course project to detect CIFAR-10 images and classify them by
creating a Nerual Network.

## How to run?
To view the project notebook, clone the project:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/amirhnajafiz/Neural-Networks.git
```

Now go into _notebook_ dircectory, then _NN_ directory and run the following command:
```shell
jupyter notebook
```

## CNN
I also implement this project with convolotional neural network, you can check the notebook
by going into _notebook_ directory, then _CNN_ directory and run the following command:
```shell
jupyter notebook
```
